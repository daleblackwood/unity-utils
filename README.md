# unity-utils
**Utilities for use in Unity3D.**

Feel free to use them in projects of your own, I'd love a shoutout, but I'm not gonna hold you to it.

Each utility is as standalone as I can make it. You won't need the whole repository, just any top level folder.

### Audio ###
Contains an AudioPlayer and MusicPlayer which are basic implementations of audio and music players.

### License ###
It's MIT.
